# Churn_Analysis_EDA

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis aimed at uncovering the reasons behind a sudden decline in user engagement within a mobile game. The project focuses on scrutinizing the first 100 levels of the game, utilizing a combination of User Experience (UX) analysis and individual level analysis to identify potential causes and recommend optimization strategies.

## Data
The dataset encompasses a wide array of metrics pertinent to user interactions, level performance, and engagement metrics across the initial 100 levels of the game. This includes, but is not limited to, session lengths, level completion rates, user retention figures, and in-game behavioral data.

## Analysis Approach

### Data Quality Review
- Initial data assessment to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and potential outliers.
- Implementation of cleaning procedures to ensure data integrity for subsequent analysis.

### Data Preparation
- Transformation of data types to enhance compatibility with analytical tools and techniques.
- Augmentation of the dataset with calculated columns to aid in pattern recognition and facilitate more nuanced analysis.

### Analytical Focus Areas
1. **User Experience (UX) Stage Analysis**: Classification of users based on their cumulative playtime to evaluate how engagement levels vary across different UX stages.
2. **Level-Specific Analysis**: Examination of user engagement metrics at the individual level to pinpoint levels with abnormal patterns of user drop-offs or decreased engagement.

### Visualization and Insights
- Development of insightful visualizations to illustrate patterns and anomalies within the data, with a particular emphasis on UX stages and individual level performance.
- Utilization of various graphical representations including, but not limited to, heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts to elucidate the findings.

### Recommendations and Summary
- Compilation of actionable recommendations based on the analysis to enhance user engagement and rectify identified issues.
- Conclusive summary of key insights and suggested strategies for game optimization.
